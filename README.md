## Configuration

The `config.xml` file allows you to customize the following settings:

- `Columns`: Defines the number of slot columns available in the dew collector.
- `Rows`: Defines the number of slot rows available in the dew collector.

The

Example:

```xml
<config>
    <columns>3</columns>
    <rows>2</rows>
</config>
```

The `Config/XUi/windows.xml` needs to match your `config.xml` file :

Example
```xml
<configs>
	<set xpath="//window[@name='windowDewCollector']/rect/grid/@cols">3</set>
	<set xpath="//window[@name='windowDewCollector']/rect/grid/@rows">2</set>
</configs>
```

The `Config/blocks.xml` file allows you to customize the collection rate :

- `MinConvertTime`: Minimum amount of time to obtain water, 600 Game Seconds = 1 Game Hours.
- `MaxConvertTime`: Maximum amount of time to obtain water. 

Example:
```xml
<set xpath="/blocks/block[@name='cntDewCollector']/@MinConvertTime">1800</set>
<set xpath="/blocks/block[@name='cntDewCollector']/@MaxConvertTime">3600</set>
```
